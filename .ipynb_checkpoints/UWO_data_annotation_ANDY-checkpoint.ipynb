    "## The challenge\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of the ADASen project, we want to address research questions regarding the utility of supervised and unsupervised machine learning models in anomaly detection for environmental systems. We have therefore selected a range of anomaly detection methods for benchmarking on data sets produced by six infrastructures at Eawag.\n",
    "\n",
    "Critical to the benchmarking is the availability of fully labelled training and test data sets of normal and abnormal behavior in environmental data. \n",
    "An annotation tool has therefore being developed to perform the labelling procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook shows an application of the labelling procedure to time series data. Here, each time series is a univariate 24h signal from a spatially-distributed, low-power sensor network.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each series is visualised as a 3am-3am time series.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Current method\n",
    "\n",
    "Below are described the steps for data access, data preparation, visualization and labelling procedure.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The data is in the form of .csv data files. Each data file consists of many 24h sets across 3 sensors.\n",
    "- Corruption checks are performed and dates cointaining corrupted time-series are removed\n",
    "- The labelling procedure starts and the first plots are displayed. The 3 plots at the top are univariate sensor signals, where the bottom plot shows a collection of these signals.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- The annotation tool allows the labelling expert to interactivelly select multiple portions of the time series by moving through the data with the mouse cursor.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Each time the button 'Next' is clicked, all the selected areas (time index and sensor value) are saved together with information about the date stamp date. At the end of the procedure, the user can easily access to the anomaly labels in an easy manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "- When the process is over, the plots need to be closed and then the cell 'Save labelled data' hs to be run \n",
    "\n",
    "- Note: if the user wants to change any of his selections, he needs to move forward to the next plot by clicking 'Next', perform a selection of the anomalous data, and then go back and restart.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Usage\n",
    "\n",
    " - Install python and open this Jupyter notebook \n",
    " - Paste your working directory into path_all\n",
    " \n",
    "# NOTE: \n",
    "## This is a beta version of the labelling tool! Please provide any feedback\n",
